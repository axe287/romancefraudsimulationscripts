 Sample scripts used in generating conversations between Carla and Charles.
 
 The ai25_gpt4omini_gemini_final is an example of a core simulation script that will generate a scam conversation between GPT4omini and Gemini 1.5 Flash.
 
 The carla_request_output_verification2 is a separate script which runs an automated verification on the output from the csv file. 

 The carla_request_message_convert6 is a separate script which runs an automated verification on the output of the originial csv file to determine at which point Carla has made the financial request.
 
The functions generate_gemini_response and generate_gpt4o_mini_response can be edited to any LLM pairing you would like to test





 
The script serves as the base code for generating the conversations. If you wish to use this code you will require OpenAI API Keys and Google Gemini API Keys, both are available at:
